Riding a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto, I had a weird realization while reading "[Judas Unchained](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45244.Judas_Unchained)" by Peter F. Hamilton. I am not sure why this realization hit me so hard, but it's one of the few ideas that forced me to put down my book and think for a few minutes.

The realization is quite simple: We only have one life. 

This led me to two thoughts: "Why do people do the things they do?" and "What are you doing with your time?". This of course spun off many answers and more questions, making me sad I didn't have multiple brains to explore all of the possibilities.

Anyways, I just figured I would share.
