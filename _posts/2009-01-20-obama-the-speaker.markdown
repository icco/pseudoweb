Well today we ushered in a new era. I'm not sure exactly what I want to say about this, except that President Obama's Inaugural Address was beautiful, as was the inaugural poem. I have stolen the New York Times transcriptions of these for safe keeping, but I'm going to publish my copies here.

</ul>
Finally the above image was grabbed off of Flickr, which has a great pool of photo's from the event.
