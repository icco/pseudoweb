So I'm still alive, don't worry too much. I'm rebuilding this site again, so things may not work and stuff may be missing. If you see something broken just drop me a comment. I am now using a modified version of <a href="http://scottwallick.com/">Simplr</a>, although you won't be able to see most of the modifications till I upload them (sometime this weekend). I promise to start posting again soon...
