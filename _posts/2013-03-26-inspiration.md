Laying in bed one night, I realized my mind was blank. It had no inspiration. No want to create things. I go through these periods on occasion, but this is the first one I've had in a while. So I decided to tweet about it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Hmm. Lacking inspiration right now... what inspires you?</p>&mdash; Nat Welch (@icco) <a href="https://twitter.com/icco/status/315019021747630080">March 22, 2013</a></blockquote>

I wasn't really expecting much of a response, but instead I got a stream of funny, interesting and thoughtful responses. Two of the tweets especially stuck with me:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/icco">icco</a> Nature in general, the vastness of the Pacific Ocean and the physical power contained there-in, as observed at Morro Bay breakwater.</p>&mdash; Mark Smith (@smittyhalibut) <a href="https://twitter.com/smittyhalibut/status/315146717567782914">March 22, 2013</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/icco">icco</a> Art. Stories that create emotion. Anger.</p>&mdash; David Horn (@Madrox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Madrox/status/315021547033227264">March 22, 2013</a></blockquote>

Then, following that, I also had lunch with the infamous [Alex Baldwin](http://www.alexbaldwin.com/about). Baldwin mentioned that he had been talking to [technoweenie](http://techno-weenie.net/about) about DJing. This for some reason sparked within me a need to sit down and try putting some songs together.

So I did just that.

Mind you, it's rough, and only my second attempt ever at combining songs. But this got me inspired. I had started created things again. It amazes me that the act of doing one thing can just unblock the mind and free up your brain to start thinking about everything else.

This is actually part of the reason why I created [Tumble.io](http://tumble.io).

By providing a page where I can link together all of my thoughts, I can attempt to create links between what I read and what I see in the world. And sometimes, just maybe, this will cause me to want to create more things, which brings me happiness.

And shit, in the end, that's all I really want.
