I have a problem. Quite simply: I very rarely finish things. Sometimes this "problem" is helpful to me, other times it is incredibly frustrating. Below I've taken time to list some pros and cons of my current approach to personal projects. This post does not provide much of a solution, but is more of a reflective exercise.

## Pros

 * Explore a wide range of new technologies
 * Think about a ton of different projects

## Cons

 * Get in to funks because of "I'm never going to finish this, why even start."
 * Rarely develop very deep understand of technologies I experiment with.
