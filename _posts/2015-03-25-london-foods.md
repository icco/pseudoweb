After a year in London, I figured I'd write up the places I have eaten often and enjoyed. These are in no order and the organization is rough to say the least.

## Food

 * [Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com/)

Amazing Indian food. The wait is usually long, but worth it. I lad some sort of slow cooked lamb that was out of this world.

 * [Busaba Eathai](http://www.busaba.com/)

A chain of Thai restaurants. Has a cool atmosphere and pretty good food.

 * [Pham Sushi](http://www.phamsushi.co.uk/)

This was the sushi place closest to my flat, so I ate here like once a week. They have two restaurants across the street from each other. One does take away and has some seats. The other is a fancy restaurant. The full restaurant was always packed, so I always went for the relaxed Take Away shop. Not amazing, but some of the better sushi for the price that I had in London.

 * [Wagamama](http://www.wagamama.com/)

A huge chain. I fell in love with the Ginger Chicken Udon. If I didn't want to think and was tired of wandering, Wagamama pretty much always has an empty seat and is pretty fast.

 * [Bone Daddies](http://www.bonedaddies.com/peter-st-soho/)

The best ramen I had in London. Place is small and always packed, but is open till midnight and serves food fast.

 * [Dirty Burger](http://www.eatdirtyburger.com/)

A greasy burger, but quite good.

 * [Byron](https://www.byronhamburgers.com/)

A chain that's all over London. Courgette fries, one of their burgers (they were all solid), and the boiler room special (a pale ale and a shot of Makers Mark) was a good dinner if I was missing home.

 * [Tozi](http://www.tozirestaurant.co.uk/)

Fantastic Italian small plates. Menu doesn't really change, but just bring a large group and order two of everything.

 * [Cay Tre](http://caytre.co.uk/)

Really good Pho. They also have other Vietnamese dishes, but I only ever had the Pho. My favorite was the Garlic Hanoi Pho with Chinese dough and a beer on a rainy day. Packed at dinner time, but easy to find a seat for lunch.

 * [The Breakfast Club](http://www.thebreakfastclubcafes.com/locations/hoxton/)

They serve breakfast all day. Popular brunch place.

 * [Meat Mission](http://www.meatmission.com/)

Delicious burgers, but the wait is insane. Has a resident DJ spinning most nights, so it's pretty loud.

 * [Homeslice](http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/home)

My favorite pizza in London. They do one size (20") with a delicious thin sourdough crust and a daily changing board of toppings.

 * [Pizza East](http://www.pizzaeast.com/shoreditch)

Good pizza in Shoreditch.

 * Whitecross Street Market - [yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/whitecross-market-london) &amp; [4sq](https://foursquare.com/v/whitecross-street-market/4ac518eef964a52021ad20e3)

Weekday lunch only, amazing food stalls. Changes often, and I've never had a bad meal. Cash only.

 * [Borough Market](http://boroughmarket.org.uk/)

Open only a few days a week, but has delicious food to eat, plus a huge market. Gets really crowded, and a lot of places only take cash.

 * [J + A Cafe](http://jandacafe.com/)

Great brunch place when it's sunny out. Most of their seating is in a quiet alley way.

## Coffee


 * [Fleet River Bakery](http://fleetriverbakery.com/)

Nice little bakery and coffee shop near Holborn station. Grab a delicious piece of banana bread and a Long Black and go for a walk in the park across the street, or through the London School of Economics and down Fleet Street.

 * [Paper &amp; Cup](http://www.paperandcup.co.uk/)

Great coffee that goes to a good cause.

 * Montparnasse Cafe - [yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/montparnasse-cafe-london-2) &amp; [4sq](https://foursquare.com/v/montparnasse-cafe/4baf60fff964a52080fb3be3)

I actually discovered this on my last day in London. Cute French bakery that has really good coffee, and killer breakfast baguettes.

 * [Ozone](http://www.ozonecoffee.co.uk/)

Delicious coffee roaster, and also a good brunch place. If they have it, get the Duck hash or the duck confit eggs. Also, their v60 pour over is always good.

 * [Lantana](http://www.lantanacafe.co.uk/index.html)

Solid brunch place in Shoreditch that does a lot of good food, and decent coffee.

 * [Department of Coffee and Social Affairs](http://departmentofcoffee.com/)

Love it for the name, kept comming back for the coffee and atmosphere.

 * [Prufrock](http://www.prufrockcoffee.com/)

Claims to be the best espresso in London. Not sure if I agree, but it is really good. They also offer coffee brewing classes.

 * [Foxcroft and Ginger](http://foxcroftandginger.co.uk/)

Really hit or miss. Decent coffee and decent food, but I've had a few orders which were not up to par. Main selling point is it's next to Gosh! Comics, so you can buy a few trades and then get an eggs benedict and a pour over and lose a few hours.

 * [Flat White](http://www.flatwhitesoho.co.uk/)

They have an amazing flat white, but not much seating.

 * [Look mum no hands!](http://www.lookmumnohands.com/)

Bike shop with good coffee and lots of seating.

 * [Taylor St Baristas](http://www.taylor-st.com/)

Decent café.

 * [Allpress Espresso](http://uk.allpressespresso.com/)

I could never get in to their actual store, but they have a great walk up cash only coffee bar outside around the corner.

 * [Shoreditch Grind](http://www.shoreditchgrind.com/)

Over hyped, but if there isn't a line, they make a decent croissant sandwich and an adequate latte.

 * [Fix Coffee](http://www.fix-coffee.co.uk/#about)

They have a few shops. I really like their mochas. Usually have lots of seating.

 * [Timberyard](http://timberyardlondon.com/)

Has a few shops. I actually really liked their green tea and hummus sandwiches, but they also make a solid Latte.

 * [Workshop](http://www.workshopcoffee.com/)

Really cool place with great coffee.

## Beer

 * [Sky Pod Bar](http://skygarden.london/sky-pod-bar)

No real selection, but amazing views. Wait till they are giving free entry to the public and drink a beer while watching the sunset from atop the walkie talkie building.

 * [Cask](http://www.caskpubandkitchen.com/)

"The Google SRE Bar" or the bar with lots of variety and deliciousness. Also makes a great burger.

 *[Brew Dog](https://www.brewdog.com/bars)

Lots of hoppy beers. Their Shoreditch location is usually packed. I would recommend Sheppard's Bush if you want to sit and enjoy your beer. Both sites have great selection though. I've never been to the Camden one.

 * [Craft Beer Co.](http://thecraftbeerco.com/)

There are a few of these, they are an extension of Cask, but usually even more packed because of the more desirable locations.

 * Any pub.

Seriously, just go into the nearest pub. It's probably pretty decent.

## Other

 * [Columbia Road Flower Market](http://www.columbiaroad.info/)

Fresh flowers. Men yelling at you to buy their flowers. Quite the experience.

 * [Gosh! Comics](http://www.goshlondon.com/)

Two floors with a fantastic selection of comics, trades, graphic novels, indie publications and nice people.

 * [Holland Park](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/leisureandlibraries/parksandgardens/yourlocalpark/hollandpark.aspx)

Gorgeous flowers, a Japanese Garden, a great youth hostel, lots of benches.

 * [Hamstead Heath](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/Pages/default.aspx)

Great place to walk on a sunny day.

 * [Primrose Hill](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/the-regents-park/things-to-see-and-do/primrose-hill)

Great view of London.
