So I've been a little slow to write this, mainly due to the fact that I've been having trouble catching up on sleep. But two weekends ago, I had an amazing weekend, because I spent the weekend at PAX in Seattle. Now I should have  cool and interesting reveiw of PAX, but now two weeks later it doesnt look like it's gonna happen. Why? because <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html">I have NADD</a>.

here are some good reviews though:

<a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/pax-technica-looking-back-at-penny-arcade-expo-2007.ars/1">Ars Technica's Post </a>

I'll post some pictures eventually too.

p.s. read the article I linked to on Nerd Attention Deficit Disorder (NADD). It describes me so well it's scary.
