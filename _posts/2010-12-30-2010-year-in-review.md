Ah yes, 2010. You were a good year. You, like any year, had your ups and your downs, but at the very least you provided me with some good data.

In 2010, I started playing with foursquare. I didn't stick with it too long, but it created some interesting graphs. For example, I went to New York City to visit my friend Aaron over the summer:

And on this map, you can see where I work, go to school and play:

This year I also got really into ruby and GitHub. Here are a few projects I worked on:

 * <https://github.com/icco/thestack> 
 * <https://github.com/iFixit/Javascript_Embed>
 * <https://github.com/icco/coffee_shop>
 * <https://github.com/icco/Agent355>
 * <https://github.com/icco/Resume>
 * <https://github.com/icco/tracstats>
 * <https://github.com/icco/Project-Megan>

I also listened to a lot of music. Because I use [Last.FM](http://last.fm) to log everything to listen to, I have a nice little graph to show my last year of listening.

Also, there are a few other listening graphs...

 * [Listening Clock](/images/2010/12/ListeningClock-Last.fmPlayground_1293132524380.png)

And I continued to work at iFixit, which generates all kinds of fun graphs. Here is a graph showing how often I commited on average per day.
