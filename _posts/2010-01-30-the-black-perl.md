I know, I know, two posts in a row? What is he thinking? Well I came across
this post on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1089420">Hacker
News</a>, and it was pretty awesome, so I wanted to repost it here.

This block of code is written in Perl. I don't know much Perl, but it's a
pretty cool language, and I do love poetry. Anything that can combine poetry
and code is awesome in my book.

Without further ado, the "Black Perl" by Author Unkown.

{% highlight perl %}
BEFOREHAND: close door, each window & exit; wait until time.
    open spellbook, study, read (scan, select, tell us);
write it, print the hex while each watches,
    reverse its length, write again;
    kill spiders, pop them, chop, split, kill them.
        unlink arms, shift, wait & listen (listening, wait),
sort the flock (then, warn the "goats" & kill the "sheep");
    kill them, dump qualms, shift moralities,
    values aside, each one;
        die sheep! die to reverse the system
        you accept (reject, respect);
next step,
    kill the next sacrifice, each sacrifice,
    wait, redo ritual until "all the spirits are pleased";
    do it ("as they say").
do it(*everyone***must***participate***in***forbidden**s*e*x*).
return last victim; package body;
    exit crypt (time, times & "half a time") & close it,
    select (quickly) & warn your next victim;
AFTERWORDS: tell nobody.
    wait, wait until time;
    wait until next year, next decade;
        sleep, sleep, die yourself,
        die at last
