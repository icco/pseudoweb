I had dinner with Annie Beug last night, and she gave me three pieces of advice for life:

 > One: Save for retirement.

Open up a [Roth IRA][roth] and fill it up. Right now. Compound interest is the shit.

 > [Floss][floss].

I've heard all kinds of crazy stories why you should floss. Most of them are scare tactics by doctors, but in general, you should do it.

 > Never mix uppers with downers.

Both advice for drug use and people.

None are profoundly amazing by themselves, but I think they go quite well with my general life goal of __be happy__. Anyways, happy Monday.
