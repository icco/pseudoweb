I recently saw Levi's 2011 "Go Forth" commercial. I thought it was beautiful, so I thought I would share it with you.

What makes this video so cool though, is the poetry being read. I did a little research and found the poem that is being read and included it below.

## The Laughing Heart
_Charles Bukowski_

    your life is your life
    don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.
    be on the watch.
    there are ways out.
    there is a light somewhere.
    it may not be much light but
    it beats the darkness.
    be on the watch.
    the gods will offer you chances.
    know them.
    take them.
    you can’t beat death but
    you can beat death in life, sometimes.
    and the more often you learn to do it,
    the more light there will be.
    your life is your life.
    know it while you have it.
    you are marvelous
    the gods wait to delight
    in you.

This lead me to two other videos. One is Tom Waits reading the poem, and another is the UK version of the Levi commercial. Interesting to see slightly different edits of the same B-roll.

Anyways, I just thought it was interesting. Advertising is such a predominant part of our daily lives, it's nice to see a company apply a bit of class to the medium. Of course, Levi isn't the first to do this, nor will the be the last.
