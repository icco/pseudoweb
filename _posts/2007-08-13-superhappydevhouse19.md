You know what I love? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee">Hot Coffee</a>. You know why I love Hot Coffee? Because thanks to the whole lawsuit thing, Hot Coffee doesn't remind me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">wonderfully delicious drink</a>, instead it reminds me of coding and the nerd culture as a whole.

This weekend I attended <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse19">SuperHappyDevHouse 19</a>, known affectionately as shdh19. <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org">Shdh</a>, is at it's core a place for geek, nerds, designers, and developers of all kinds to meet, greet, and possibly even get a few personal projects pounded out in code. This time, shdh was located in Los Gatos, which was awesome because it was near my house. I originally went with the goal of programming, but ended up spending more time meeting people, which was better for me, I think, because I really don't know a ton of people in the area with the same interests as me. This of course is due to the fact that I haven't attended more of these events, not because they don't exist. Because in all honesty, finding computer "enthusiasts" in Silicon Valley is like finding people with bad teeth in fifteen century Britain.<!--more-->

Anywho, here is a list of <em>some</em> of the people I met:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jessicamah.com/">Jessica Mah</a> - Really cool girl. I was amazed at all of the stuff she had done, made me feel kinda lazy :p <a href="http://jessicamah.com/">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://tomicles.com/wordpress/">Tom Harrison </a>- The guy who proclaimed "I live here." Didn't talk to him too much, but I introduced myself, so I figure that counts <a href="http://tomicles.com/wordpress/">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://simblob.blogspot.com/">Amit Patel</a> - Had a really cool project using e7, the make controller, and legos<a href="http://simblob.blogspot.com/">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kelek.com/">Mike McDonald</a> - A really interesting guy. We talked a lot about his acting career. I hope to see him on the big screen sooner rather than later<a href="http://www.kelek.com/">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://drewyates.net/">Andrew Yates</a> - A younger guy pursuing the silicon valley dream with an interesting startup to create something close to an online bank.<a href="http://drewyates.net/">
</a></li>
	<li>Conrad Rushing - A flash developer, he chilled with us in the hot tub for a long time. Seemed to have a very realistic view of the world</li>
	<li>Albert Mao - Bio-engineering(or something close to that) student. He seemed like a very competent programmer for his age.</li>
	<li><a href="http://sargo.com/joel">Joël Franusic</a> - One of the main greeters. He lives in SLO, which is awesome. I kept forgetting he was out of school though, which made me look like an idiot, but whatever, he seems like an awesome guy.</li>
</ul>
I met way more than this, although I have the memory of a ninety year old woman. A few others I have buisness cards sitting on my desk at home, which I'll add soon, I promise.

There was also this CNet reporter, whose name I forgot to write down. I described my project to her, and I am a little worried about how she interpreted it. Also, I probably shouldn't have mentioned what school I went to, but whatever. If i am lucky I won't even end up in the article. She did take a good picture of me though, which was cool. 

Anyway, my photos are up on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/icco">Flickr</a>, and all of the photos taken by everyone at the event are<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/shdh19/interesting/"> tagged SHDH19</a>. It was a blast and I can't wait till my next geek event this summer, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlock">BarCampBlock</a>.
