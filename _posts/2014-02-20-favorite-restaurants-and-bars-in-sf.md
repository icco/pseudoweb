Now that I no longer live in SF, I don't feel as protective about the places I frequented often. For someone who hasn't lived in SF, this may seem like a strange sentiment. But once you get used to long lines and impossible seating every time your favorite restaurant makes it onto some foodies blog, many become hesitant to share where they frequent.

So now that I don't have to frequent places, I totally feel alright sending more foot traffic and dollars to these wonderful places.

I made [a Foursquare List](https://foursquare.com/icco/list/favorite-food--bars-in-sf) for easy consumption, but I'll try to explain them a little below.

1. Mad Dog in the Fog

530 Haight St btwn Steiner & Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA

Mad Dog holds a certain place in my heart because it was the first bar I ever went to in SF. It's a simple beer bar with a decent selection, always has some game on (with a leaning towards Soccer), and has some decent pub food if you need to eat.

2. Mikkeller Bar

34 Mason St at Market St, San Francisco, CA

Mikkeller only recently opened in SF, but has an amazing selection of beer, food and atmosphere. It's in the TL, which is kind of shady, but it's very close to the Powell muni station, making it pretty accessible from the rest of the city.

3. The Village Grill

160 West Portal Ave btw Vincente and 14th, San Francisco, CA

Just simple and great breakfasts. A classic SF diner out on West Portal's main drag. I highly recommend the chorizo scramble.

4. AMASIA Hide’s Sushi bar

149 Noe St at Henry St, San Francisco, CA

I really like this sushi restaurant. It's a great place for a date or if you wanna meet up with someone and actually talk. It reminds me of someone's living room. Always get the sake special and lots of nigiri and sashimi. The rolls aren't great, but the fish is incredibly fresh and well prepared. Note, I doubt they can sit a group larger than four.

5. Devil's Teeth Baking Company

3876 Noriega St btw 45th & 46th, San Francisco, CA

Best bakery in SF. Try the donut muffin and the breakfast sandwich.

6. King of Thai Noodle

1541 Taraval St at 24th Ave, San Francisco, CA

I love these guys. The original King of Thai in SF, and it pumps out delicious greasy Thai food. Always fast, open till 1:30 and very friendly.

7. 21st Amendment Brewery & Restaurant

563 2nd St at De Boom St, San Francisco, CA

This place is the coders brewery. Located in the heart of SOMA, you'll always see people after conferences or work days congregating here. Lots of dudes, but all amazing beer. The SF classic is the "Hell or High Watermelon", but they have a ton of beers that are only available at the bar which you should try out. Ask your waiter, they're very knowledgeable. I usually get the burger when I'm here.

8. Sightglass Coffee

270 7th St btwn Howard & Folsom St, San Francisco, CA

If you have a friend who likes coffee, and wants to experience true hipster coffee, take them here. Amazing coffee and fun atmosphere.

9. City Beer Store

1168 Folsom St. btwn 8th & Rausch, San Francisco, CA

Beer Nerd Paradise. Only open till 9 or 10pm most nights, but always has ten amazing micro-brews on tap. I've never been disappointed with my selection. No real food to speak of, but the thai place across the street is decent. Also acts as a small beer grocery store, and sells a ton of unique and hard to find beers in bottles, which you can either drink on premise or take home.

10. Dumpling Kitchen

1935 Taraval St btw 29th & 30th, San Francisco, CA

My favorite dumpling place in SF if you have a party of more than four people. Just bring like eight people before noon, and order one of everything. Not very vegetarian friendly.

11. Giordano Bros.

3108 16th St at Valencia, San Francisco, CA

Basically a Pittsburgh bar. Great beer selection, but it's their sandwiches which destroy all of the things. Two thick slices of bread, meat of your choice, egg (get the egg), french fries, sauce and cheese. My favorite is the Hot Coppa sandwich, but all of them are amazing.

12. 1015 Folsom

1015 Folsom St at 6th St, San Francisco, CA

One of SF's great clubs. Always has great shows, but the lines can be a bit long. Buy your tickets ahead of time.

13. Mozzarella di Bufala

69 West Portal Ave, San Francisco, CA

Amazing pizza and amazing Brazilian dishes. Great for a chill dinner.

Well that's all of them. I hope you go try them out.
